# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nelli

I'm Nelli, a curious learner exploring the world of open source and collaborative development.

![Introduction to GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Introduction_to_GitHub-Completed-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=222)


I recently completed the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course.

## ðŸ“˜ What the course included
- Creating a public repository.
- Opening a branch.
- Making a commit.
- Submitting and merging a pull request.
- Editing a simple README file written in Markdown.

> *Please note: GitHub does not issue any official badge or certificate upon completion of this course.*

## ðŸ”Ž Why this repository exists
This repository was created as part of the course assignment. Its purpose is to help activate a profile README that appears publicly on my GitHub profile.

I'm excited to continue exploring what GitHub has to offer and share my journey as I learn more!
